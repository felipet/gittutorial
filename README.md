## Tutorial Organisation

This tutorial is split in two chapters:

1. A theoretical background chapter that explains most of the terms used, and other detailed explanation about how **Git** works.
2. A hands-on chapter that puts in practice all the content from the previous chapter.

It is advised to read Chapter 1 first. The Chapter 2 expects that the user of this tutorial understand the internals of **Git** and the basics of the workflow. If you get lost during Chapter 2, go to Chapter 1 to refresh concepts. Links are provided through the chapters to join the contents from both sides. Further reading material is also linked to extended some examples or explanations of advanced topics.
